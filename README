Solitaire in ExtJS

Simple port of the windows Solitaire game for Ext JS.  Runs locally, no need for server except to serve the files.

To do:

* Save game state to cookie so as not to lose between refreshes
* Use a custom build of ExtJS as only a small part of the framework is used here
* Finish styling UI components
* Make 'New Game' functionality work
* Add time taken and score to bottom status bar
* Update top menu with links to view source and download from Github
