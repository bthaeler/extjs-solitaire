Solitaire in ExtJS

Simple port of the windows Solitaire game for Ext JS.  Runs locally, no need for server except to serve the files.

To do:

* Save game state to cookie so as not to lose between refreshes
* Finish styling UI components
* Make 'New Game' functionality work properly (as in not refresh the whole window!)
* Make a 'cool' animation for the end
* Add a 'hint' option which flashes a card

Bugs:

* onInitDrag in Card.js often fires many times, which causes the StatusProxy to flicker as it is recreated - find out why... (could be to do with how the cachedTarget is set in that file)
* There seems to be an event firing leak when double clicking cards.  Before they are moved they fire the event several times.

Changelog:

18/12/2008:
* Allowed double-click on a top card to stack to automatically put it onto appropriate suitstack if the move is permitted
* When moving a revealed card from a stack, any cards on top of it will also move
* Using a custom build of ExtJS as only a small part of the framework is used here
* Changed deck cycling direction (bottom card moved to top instead of top to bottom)
* Updated top menu with links to view source and download from Github
* Reorganised files, took all classes out of the Ext.ux namespace
* Added time taken and score to bottom status bar

04/01/2008:
* Updated DragDropMgr to use intersect instead of point
* When multiple cards are dragged they are now all shown in the drag proxy
